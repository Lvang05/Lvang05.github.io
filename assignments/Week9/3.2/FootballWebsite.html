<!-- History about football -->
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>American football originated in the late 19th century, evolving from two English sports — rugby and
                soccer. The first recorded game was played in 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton, but the sport truly
                began to take shape in the 1880s thanks to rule changes introduced by Walter Camp, often called the
                "Father of American Football." Camp established the line of scrimmage, the down-and-distance system, and
                other fundamental rules that gave the game a more structured and strategic identity. By the early 1900s,
                college football had exploded in popularity, though it also faced criticism for violence and injuries,
                which led to reforms and the eventual creation of the NCAA in 1906.</p>
            <p>Professional football began gaining traction in the early 20th century, and in 1920, the American
                Professional Football Association was formed — later renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922.
                For decades, the NFL competed with other leagues, most notably the AFL, which eventually merged with the
                NFL in 1970. This merger gave rise to the modern Super Bowl and a unified, nationwide league. Since
                then, the NFL has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry, with the Super Bowl becoming a major
                cultural event. American football today is a blend of athleticism, strategy, and entertainment — and
                remains one of the most-watched and passionately followed sports in the United States.</p>
            <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
            <p>Understanding the rules of American football is essential for both players and fans. Here are some of the
                key rules to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Four Downs:</strong> Each team has four attempts (downs) to advance the ball 10 yards. If
                    successful, they earn a new set of downs.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> A touchdown is worth 6 points, followed by an extra point (1) or a
                    two-point conversion. Field goals are worth 3 points.</li>
                <li><strong>Kickoff:</strong> Games start with a kickoff, and after each score, the ball is kicked to
                    the opposing team to begin their possession.</li>
                <li><strong>Offsides & False Starts:</strong> Players cannot cross the line of scrimmage before the ball
                    is snapped. Doing so results in a penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Pass Interference:</strong> Defenders cannot make contact with a receiver before the ball
                    arrives. This results in a significant yardage penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Turnovers:</strong> Fumbles and interceptions result in a change of possession, giving the
                    opposing team control of the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Length:</strong> A standard NFL game consists of four 15-minute quarters, with a
                    halftime break between the second and third quarters.</li>
            </ul>
