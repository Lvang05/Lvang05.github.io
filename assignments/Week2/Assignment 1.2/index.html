                and snorkelers, Cancun is a paradise. The crystal-blue Caribbean waters hold an abundance of underwater
                wildlife, and most of the resorts have trainers who can show you which end of the fin to flap and how to
                handle the equipment. Want to taste the Caribbean nightlife? The hotel zone in Cancun is your hot spot,
                with numerous world-famous bars and nightclubs that drive the night to the beat of everything from salsa
                to club mixes and world sounds.
