                Kobe IX Elite Low EM Protro $190
            </h2>
            Kobe's comeback from a torn Achilles inspired generations of past, present and future hoopers to keep
            fighting. This Kobe IX brings back the shoe that supported the Black Mamba during his triumphant
            return to the floor and gives it an upgrade. An engineered mesh upper complements a springy
            responsive React foam in Kobe's updated low-top masterpiece.</p>

            <p>
                Even on the gloomy days, A'ja still tries to find a way to shine. This A'One symbolizes happiness and
                helps bring out the energy of optimism. The layers of yellow gradually become brighter from the inner
                core to the outer limits, so you and A'ja can stunt on the floor. And to help keep her smiling, plush
                Cushlon 3.0 foam provides unapologetic comfort.</p>

                Genisus gives you the tools you need to redefine the game. This version nods to one of LeBron's favorite
