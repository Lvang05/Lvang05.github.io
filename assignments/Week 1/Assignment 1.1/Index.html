            <p>
                During my free time, I enjoy playing golf. I recently got back into the sport and usually go out with
                friends or sometimes with my dad. Another hobby of mine is watching football. I'm a huge NFL fan, so
                whenever there's a game on, I'm usually watching it. While I don't have any experience with web
                development yet, I'm excited to learn more about it and explore what it has to offer.

                I have high expectations for this class and hope to learn a lot throughout the semester. I'm really
                interested in understanding how websites are created and in learning a new programming language. I also
                look foward to learning as much I can from my instructor, TJ. Overall, I'm excited about this class and
                hope to gain something out of it by the end of the semester.
