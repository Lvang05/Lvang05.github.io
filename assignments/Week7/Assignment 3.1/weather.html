                    <h2>Mild Temperatures and Clear Skies Expected This Week</h2>
                    <p>
                        Residents can look forward to a stretch of pleasant weather in the coming days, with mild
                        temperatures, clear skies, and light winds.

                        Daytime highs are expected to range between 68°F and 75°F, offering comfortable conditions for
                        outdoor plans. Overnight lows may drop to around 54°F, so a light jacket might be needed in the
                        evenings and early mornings.

                        There is little to no chance of rain throughout the week, though some scattered clouds may
                        appear midweek. Winds will stay calm, averaging around 6-10 mph.

                        Local weather officials recommend staying hydrated during warmer afternoons and watching for
                        slightly elevated pollen levels due to the dry air.
