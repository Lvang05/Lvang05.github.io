                    <h2>Community-Centered News Agency Statement</h2>
                    <p>

                        At Leon's news, we believe that trusted journalism begins and ends with the community.
                        As a dedicated local news agency, our mission is to deliver accurate, timely, and relevant
                        information that reflects the voices, stories, and values of the people we serve.

                        Our newsroom is not just a place where stories are written — it's where the community comes
                        together. Whether we're covering city council meetings, spotlighting local heroes, or addressing
                        pressing issues like education, safety, or economic development, we put our readers at the heart
                        of
                        every headline.

                        We work closely with schools, neighborhood organizations, cultural institutions, and small
                        businesses to ensure inclusive coverage that empowers and informs. We also welcome contributions
                        and
                        feedback from residents, because we believe journalism should be a two-way conversation — not
                        just a
                        broadcast.

                        At our core, we are more than a news outlet — we are a bridge between people, a platform for
                        dialogue, and a trusted companion in community growth.
