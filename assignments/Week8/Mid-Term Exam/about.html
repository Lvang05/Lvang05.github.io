                <p>
                    Founded in 2010, Leon's Real Estate Group began as a small family-run agency with a big vision: to
                    bring honesty, integrity, and personalized service to the local housing market. Over the years,
                    we've grown into a trusted name in real estate, helping hundreds of families find their perfect
                    single-family homes. Built on a foundation of strong community relationships and a deep
                    understanding of the neighborhoods we serve, Leon's Real Estate Group is proud to be a locally owned
                    and operated business that puts people first.
                </p>
